# Java-Based-Unix-Shell
The JShell program is a Java implementation of a bash shell. The following  * commands are included: exit, mkdir, cd, ls, pwd, pushd, popd, history, cat,  * echo, man. The goal of this project is to make smart design choices about  * when to use: inheritance, composition, polymorphism, generics, reflection  * and/or interfaces. Further, it was to practice developing in an Agile  * environment; writing dailyScrum meeting logs and meeting with our team to  * write sprint backlogs and a product backlog. Finally, we also created an   * auto tester using JUnit and assert and then generated documentation using  * Javadocs. Logistics: Collaborated and commited code using SVN
