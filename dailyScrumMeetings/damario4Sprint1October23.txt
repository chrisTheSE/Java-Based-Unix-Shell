What did I work on in the last three days? 
    - worked on adding missing the CRC cards and making revisions to them
    - added a story to the productBacklog
    - talked about CRC card revisions with team member

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - complete revisions and perfect CRC cards with team
    - start working on and testing Exit

Am I blocked on anything?  
    - need to ketch on all course content so that I can better understand what I must do for Assignment 2 and not fall behind
