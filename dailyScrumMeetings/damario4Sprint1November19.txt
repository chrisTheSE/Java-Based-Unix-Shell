What did I work on in the last three days? 
    - brainstormed ways to work out redirecting StandardOutput to an outFile to make
    - started attempting ways to implement StandardOutput to outFile
    - added removeDirectory method to Cache to enable removing a no longer existing directory
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - discuss and decide how to actually implement StandardOutput to outFile with team
    - implement StandardOutput to outFile for all the relevant classes
    - fix some of the repeated code in the classes for error checking and make it only be done in one place

Am I blocked on anything?  
    - discuss with team the change in the structure for the implementation of StandardOutput to outFile
