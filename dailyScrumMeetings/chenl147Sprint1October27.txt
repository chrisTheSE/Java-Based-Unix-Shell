What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Started and finished the basic code for File, FileSystem, and Directory
    - Updated the crc cards to match the progress of my work


What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Update the FileSystem to accomodate any needs for other classes yet to be implemented
    - Test the basic code for File, FileSystem and Directory
    - Modify the crc cards as I see fit to the classes built
    - Implement ChangeDirectory if possible
    - Come up with a solution for the issue regarding tracking the current directory

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Couldn't implement ChangeDirectory yet because we have yet to build a tracker of the current directory
