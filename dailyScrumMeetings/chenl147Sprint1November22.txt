What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Started the test cases for Remove
    - Prepared the set up for the test cases for Tree

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Update the implementation of MakeDirectory to satisfy new requirements
    - Start the code for Move and Copy 
    - Finish the test cases for Remove and Tree
    - Implement the test cases for ChangeDirectory, MakeDirectory, and PrintWorkingDirectory
    - Update the crc cards of my assigned tasks

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I cannot fully complete my test cases of Remove and Tree without having the new implementation of MakeDirectory
