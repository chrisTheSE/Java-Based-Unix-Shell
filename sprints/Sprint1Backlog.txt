User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

a) As an user, I want to continuously be able to input commands. 
b) As an user, I want to start the shell.
c) As an user, I want to quit the shell.
d) As an user, I want to create directories.
e) As an user, I want to change directories.
f) As an user, I want to see the contents of a directory.

Specific tasks to be accomplished:

a-1. (CommandLineReader) Begin coding the structure of the command line interpreter
a-2. (InputReader) Write basic code for InputReader class
a-3. (JShell and InputReader) Have the shell continually prompt the user for input
a-4. (Parser) Parse the user input for proper keywords
a-5. (Command) Create command class and start adding all the requested commands as sub-classes
a-6. (Command subclasses) Create all the command subclasses (done like this so they are modular)
a-7. (Debugging & Testing) Take some time to debug and test new code. Further test compatibility with existing code
b-1. (Exit) Write the basic code for exit class
b-2. (Debugging & Testing) Take some time to debug and test new code. Further test compatibility with existing code
c-1. (JShell) Write basic code for JShell

d-1. (File) Write basic code for File
d-2. (FileSystem) Write basic code for FileSystem
d-3. (Directory) Write basic code for directory
d-4. (MakeDirectory) Write code for MakeDirectory
d-5. (Debugging & Testing) Take some time to debug and test new code. Further test compatibility with existing code
e-1. (ChangeDirectory) Write code for ChangeDirectory
e-2. (FileSystem) Ensure ChangeDirectory cooperates correctly with FileSystem
e-3. (Debugging & Testing) Take some time to debug and test new code. Further test compatibility with existing code
f-1. (List) Write code for List
f-2. (FileSystem) Ensure List cooperates correctly with FileSystem
f-3. (Debugging & Testing) Take some time to debug and test new code. Further test compatibility with existing code
