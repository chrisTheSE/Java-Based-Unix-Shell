User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

a) As an user, I want to redirect into a file the output of a command.                                   ~  3 hr
b) As an user, I want to remove a directory.                                                             ~  4 hr
c) As an user, I want to see all the subdirectories, and their content, of a directory.                  ~  3 hr
d) As an user, I want to see the whole JShell as a tree.                                                 ~  5 hr
e) As an user, I want to save the state of the JShell on my computer.                                    ~  5 hr
